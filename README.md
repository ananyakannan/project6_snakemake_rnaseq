# Project 6 — Snakemake RNA-seq Pipeline

Reimplementing Project 5's manual RNA-seq pipeline (FastQC → fastp → HISAT2 → samtools → featureCounts) as an automated Snakemake workflow.

## Status: Day 1 complete

- Set up project folder structure (`raw_data/`, `results/`)
- Installed Snakemake (v6.1.2) into the existing `rnaseq` conda environment
- Wrote first two Snakemake rules: `fastqc_raw` and `fastqc_raw_r2`, running FastQC on one sample's paired-end reads (HBR_Rep1, chr22-only)
- Learned: rule structure (input/output/shell), how Snakemake builds its job DAG from a target file, and how to run individual targets from the command line

## Next (Day 2)
- Generalize the two FastQC rules into a single rule using wildcards, so it applies across all 6 samples instead of one at a time
